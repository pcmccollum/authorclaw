AuthorClaw is a security-hardened AI agent purpose-built for fiction and nonfiction authors. Yes, it can write entire books — but that's just the beginning.

**AuthorClaw automates the boring stuff so you can focus on the creative stuff.** It handles book research, marketing competition analysis, file management, beta reading, copy editing, revision assistance, book bible building, story consistency checking, query letter drafting, literary agent research, ad copy generation, email list strategy, and more — all autonomously.

Tell it what you want. It figures out the steps, picks the right skills and tools, and executes.

> **"It's not just a writing tool. It's a writing partner, research assistant, editor, and marketing team rolled into one."**

---

## What Can It Do?

- **Write** — Draft scenes, chapters, and full manuscripts in your voice
- **Research** — Deep dives into genres, markets, historical periods, craft techniques
- **Revise** — Structural editing, pacing analysis, style consistency checks
- **Plan** — Outlines, beat sheets, series bibles, character arcs, world-building
- **Beta Read** — First-reader feedback with specific, actionable notes
- **Market** — Blurbs, ad copy, email sequences, social media content
- **Analyze** — Voice profiling (47 markers), pacing heatmaps, tension mapping
- **Format** — Export manuscripts to agent-ready DOCX, KDP PDF, EPUB, Markdown
- **Manage** — Track projects, word counts, deadlines
- **Listen** — Neural TTS voice engine with 8 author-optimized presets — hear your writing read aloud
- **Ingest Tools** — Read source code of any tool and create a new skill from it

---

## How It Works

1. **You say what you want** — via Telegram, dashboard, or API
2. **AuthorClaw plans the steps** — AI dynamically decomposes your task into executable steps
3. **Skills are auto-selected** — 39 writing skills get injected into each step's context
4. **Work happens autonomously** — each step runs through the AI, output saved to files
5. **Everything is logged** — universal activity feed tracks all agent actions in real-time

---

## Voice & Text-to-Speech

AuthorClaw includes a built-in neural voice engine powered by Microsoft Edge TTS — no API keys, no binary installation, no cost.

**8 author-optimized voice presets:**

| Preset | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| `narrator_female` | Most genres — clear, expressive (default) |
| `narrator_male` | Literary fiction, thrillers |
| `narrator_deep` | Epic fantasy, sci-fi, nonfiction |
| `narrator_warm` | Romance, memoir |
| `british_male` | Period pieces, cozy mysteries |
| `british_female` | Elegant literary fiction |
| `storyteller` | Adventure, YA |
| `dramatic` | Action, thriller, horror |

**Telegram voice features:**
- `/speak Hello world` — Generate and send a voice message
- `/speak narrator_deep In a world...` — Use a specific voice
- `/speak 3` — Read file #3 from your last `/files` listing aloud
- `/voice on` — Toggle voice mode (all chat replies become voice + text)
- `/voice narrator_deep` — Set voice mode with a specific preset
- "Read that back" — Re-read the last response as voice

**API:** `POST /api/audio/generate` with `{ text, voice, rate, pitch, volume }`

> **⚠️ Audio files are automatically deleted after 24 hours.** If you generate a voice file you want to keep (e.g., a narration of your chapter), save or download it before the auto-cleanup runs. Use `/clean audio` to clear them manually, or find them in `workspace/audio/`.

---

## Document Library & Large Manuscript Support

AuthorClaw supports uploading manuscripts of any size — from short stories to 100K+ word novels.

**Two-tier upload system:**

| Upload Type | Size | How It Works |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Small files** (< 15K words) | Short stories, chapters, articles | Stored inline in project context — full text sent to AI |
| **Large files** (15K+ words) | Novels, full manuscripts | Auto-saved to `workspace/documents/` — smart excerpts sent to AI |

**How smart excerpts work for large manuscripts:**
- The first ~4,000 words (setup, voice, style) and last ~1,000 words (current state) are sent to the AI
- A truncation marker tells the AI the full document is available on disk
- This keeps AI context manageable while giving it enough to work with
- The full manuscript is always saved in `workspace/documents/` for reference

**Document Library API:**
- `GET /api/documents` — List all documents in the library
- `POST /api/documents/upload` — Upload directly to the library (up to 50MB)
- `DELETE /api/documents/:filename` — Remove a document

**Dashboard:** Upload files via the Projects tab (Upload button). Large files are automatically saved to both the project and the central library.

---

## Dynamic Task Planning

When you give AuthorClaw a task, it doesn't use hardcoded templates. Instead:

1. The AI receives a catalog of all available skills (with descriptions and triggers)
2. The AI receives the list of Author OS tools
3. The AI dynamically plans the right number of steps, picks the right skills (39 and counting) for each
4. Each step is executed with that skill's full content injected into the AI's context
5. Results from earlier steps are chained into later steps for continuity

If AI planning fails, the system falls back to template-based planning (8 project types with pre-built step sequences). For novel pipelines, a specialized template generates 30+ steps covering premise, book bible, outline, chapter writing (with word count targets), revision, and final DOCX assembly.

---

## Skills

Skills are markdown files that teach the AI how to handle specific writing tasks:

**Core Skills (7):** full-pipeline, preference-learner, prompt-optimizer, self-improve, skill-acquisition, error-recovery, after-action-review

**Author Skills (17):** premise, outline, write, revise, book-bible, series-bible, dialogue, style-clone, research, nonfiction-research, format, beta-reader, query-letter, manuscript-hub, market-research, promote, ingest-tool

**Marketing Skills (4):** blurb-writer, ad-copy, social-media, email-list

**Tool Ingestion:** AuthorClaw can read source code of any tool and generate a new skill from it. Just say "create a skill from this code" or use `POST /api/tools/ingest`.

Skills are automatically matched by keyword triggers and injected into the AI's context. A full reference with descriptions and example trigger keywords is available in `workspace/SKILLS.txt`.

## Deployment — Defense in Depth

> **We strongly recommend running AuthorClaw inside a VM or VPS with Docker.** Your API keys, manuscripts, and creative work deserve real protection. Defense in depth means multiple security layers — not just application-level security.

### Recommended: VPS + Docker + VPN (Best Security)

This is the gold standard for always-on, secure operation:

1. **Rent a VPS** ($5-6/month) — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or Linode
2. **Install Docker** — containerizes AuthorClaw with strict resource limits
3. **Install Tailscale** — free mesh VPN, no public ports exposed
4. **Deploy AuthorClaw** — `docker compose up -d`

```bash
# On your VPS:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
tailscale up

# Clone and deploy:
git clone https://github.com/Ckokoski/authorclaw.git
cd authorclaw/docker
docker compose up -d
```

**Why this matters:**
- VPS isolates AuthorClaw from your personal machine
- Docker containers limit file access and resource usage
- Tailscale VPN means zero public ports — only your devices can connect
- Telegram works 24/7 even when your computer is off
- Your manuscripts and API keys never leave the VPS

### Alternative: Local VM (Good Security)

If you prefer running locally:

1. **VirtualBox/UTM** — free VM software
2. **Ubuntu 24.04** — lightweight Linux inside the VM
3. **Run AuthorClaw natively** or with Docker inside the VM

```bash
# In your VM:
bash /media/sf_authorclaw-transfer/run.sh
```

**Why a VM helps:**
- Isolates AuthorClaw from your host OS
- If something goes wrong, the VM is disposable
- Shared folders let you copy files in/out safely
- Snapshots let you roll back to a known-good state

### Minimum: Local Development (Acceptable)

Running directly on your machine works fine for development and testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ckokoski/authorclaw.git
cd authorclaw && npm install
npx tsx gateway/src/index.ts
```

AuthorClaw binds to `localhost:3847` only — not exposed to the internet. But your API keys and manuscripts live on your main OS with no isolation layer.

### Security Layers Summary

| Layer | Local | VM | VPS + Docker + VPN |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------------|
| App-level vault (AES-256) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sandbox file access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Audit logging | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OS isolation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Container isolation | ❌ | Optional | ✅ |
| Network isolation (VPN) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Always-on (Telegram 24/7) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Disposable environment | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Setup Wizard

For a guided setup experience, run the interactive wizard:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh
```

It walks you through everything: OS detection, Node.js installation, Ollama setup, API key configuration, vault passphrase creation, and personalization (genre, word goals). It even generates a troubleshooting prompt you can paste into any AI chatbot if you get stuck.
